# Project #2: React Application

## Overview:

Your will be creating a front end application using React.

This is exciting! It's a lot, but we have faith in you! You've learned the necessary tools over the past few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

You will be working individually for this project, and you'll be designing the app yourself, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got! We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code!

Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals â€“ scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!
